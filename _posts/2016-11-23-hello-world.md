Hiya, my name is Khanh. This is my blog. I've written this post about a million times before. I'd start a blog, but then I wouldn't make it very far. Things are a little bit different now. I've always enjoyed writing, but unfortunately, I don't get to do much writing anymore as a computer science student. (Correction: I don't get to write much beyond code and documentation, that is.) So, here we are. My blog.

I've decided to make this blog my catch-all. As in, I'm just going to write about anything that comes to my mind. I know that's not very specific, but hey, baby steps. Actually, I've been reading books. Yes, those books. Well, technically, they're not actual books. I read my "books" on an Amazon Fire tablet, but they're still books in essence... So, as I was saying, maybe I'll write up some thoughts about the books I read and my favorite quotes from them. Yeah, that sounds like a fun idea. I'll hang on to that.

As a side note, the design of this blog was inspired by one of my favorite blogs, [The Newsprint](http://thenewsprint.co/){:target="\_blank"}.

Anyhow, that's about it for the obligatory, "hello world!" post. Don't want to be too overwhelming in my very first post. Stay tuned! ... err .. loaded?
