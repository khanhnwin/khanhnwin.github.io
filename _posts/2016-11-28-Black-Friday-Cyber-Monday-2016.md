As Thanksgiving weekend comes to a close, I figured I would give a quick recap of my post-Thanksgiving shopping. I didn't make any major purchases, however, I'd say that they're all pretty darn cool. I only went to two physical retail stores: Best Buy <del>and Lord and Taylor.</del><sup>1</sup>

#### [Best Buy] DVDs/Blu-Rays

  - **Ghostbusters**: I haven't seen this movie yet, but it has Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy, and Kate *has-me-dying-of-laughter* McKinnon... So, I'm sure I'll love it.
  - **The Man From U.N.C.L.E.**: I watched this movie on a random day with my brother a little while back. I wasn't expecting much, but I ended up loving it. It's hilarious. I just wish they'd done a better job marketing it, I would have gone to see it in theaters.
  - **Ex-Machina**: I haven't seen this movie either, but I got it on the recommendation of my brother. I'm told that it's my type of movie in that it focuses on artificial intelligence, with me being a CS major and all.
  - **The Big Short**: Also on the list of movies that I haven't seen yet. It's award-winning and filled to the brim with A-list actors. I keep hearing about it, plus it sounded interesting.

#### [Amazon] Amazon Fire Tablet 7" & 128GB SanDisk Ultra microSDXC
I picked up the Fire tablet to use as my dedicated traveling/commuting on-the-go device. I'll have a full review of it coming soon, but I will say that it's a phenomenal for the $33 that I spent on it. The Fire tablet itself comes with only 8gb of on-board storage (4gb of which is completely inaccessible), so the 128GB microSDXC should make up for it.


#### [Amazon] Amazon Echo Dot &  WeMo Switches (2x)
Perhaps my most exciting purchases, Amazon had the Echo Dot –pretty much an Echo without the speaker portion– for only $40. Plus, they also had Belkin's WeMo smart switches for $21 a pop, so it seemed like the prime opportunity for me to try out a smart home set up. The Echo hasn't come in yet, but I'll be sure to report back when it does. The WeMo switches, however, came in yesterday and they're so. freaking. cool. It feels almost... futuristic(?)... that I can control the lights in my room from my phone. I'd like to eventually build up my smart home setup to include Philips Hue bulbs as well, but that's for another day.


That's pretty much it for my Black Friday/Cyber Monday shopping this year. No major purchases, but I still got some pretty good deals. So, I'm happy.

Ultimately though, Thanksgiving is not and should never be about shopping. It is and should be about spending time with family and friends. I am so thankful that I got to spend this Thanksgiving weekend laughing hysterically with my best friends and eating a delicious Thanksgiving dinner with my family.


<sup>1. My aunts wanted to go to Lord and Taylor, so we detoured there before we went to Best Buy. I people watched at Starbucks while they shopped.</sup>
