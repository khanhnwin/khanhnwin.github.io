  <h1>Hello There!</h1>
  <img class="inset" src="/assets/site/khanh.jpg"/>
  <p>My name is Khanh Nguyen. I'm currently a pre-junior (3rd year) computer science student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA.</p>

  <p>Outside of intensely staring at my computer and tapping away at random keys, I also enjoy taking pictures, video production, and spending time with family and friends.</p>

  <p>I'm also an avid women's soccer fan. (GO USWNT!)</p>

  <p>I aspire to one day start my own tech company.</p>
